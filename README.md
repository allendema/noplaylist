This is a ever growing list of domains who track, analyse and show banners.


Devices, apps and addons used to create this are: uBlock Origin, iOS and Android phones, Blokada, Android Box, PiHole.

If you rely on G A F A M, you can search for those domains and comment them out.

If other domains are listed here, but are important, open an issue or pull request.



Also the section "Doublecheck" in the end can help.
