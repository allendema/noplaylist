# This list doesn't want to play!




This is a ever growing list of domains who track, analyse and show banners.



Devices and App/Addon used to create are: Android Box, uBlockOrigin, iOS and Android phones.



If you rely on G A F A M, you can search for those domains and comment them out.

If other domains are listed here, but are important, open an issue or pull request.



Also the section "Doublecheck" in the end can help.



This can be used with DNS Level blockers like Blokada.org https://github.com/blokadaorg/,

DNS666 https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/ or Browser Extentions like uBlockOrigin https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
